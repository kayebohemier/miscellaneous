# When I looked out the window that fateful morning, I saw a collection
# of small people milling about as though waiting for something. One of
# them met my eyes, and I drew up the sash. "Good morning," I said, "What
# has happened in this beautiful city?"
# The person replied, "Something has fallen from the sky."
# I had no memory or recollection of anything like that happening before,
# so I dressed myself and went to join them outside. A rolling fire had lit
# up the sky behind the buildings, and I wondered if retreating from the
# scene sounded like a better idea.
# Suddenly, the fire expanded to bake all of the buildings in front of us.
# I didn't know what to say or do --- perhaps cry, perhaps not --- but
# soon all of the small people started running away.
# It turned out that we were being chased by Blancmanges from the Galaxy
# of Andromeda, who had decided to invade the Earth to exploit its rich
# minerals and baking equipment innovations.
